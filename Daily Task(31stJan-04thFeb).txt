Learnings-
	Redhat disigned a package which is combination of Identity Policy and Accounting.
	Previously in the data center while configuring tha data center and configuring infra server and 
	configuring the client we had to do lot of modification
	
	IPA is combination of all these packages you can explude DHCP package out of it so IPA includes inbuilt DNS server, 
	NTP server. Kerberos, It has 389 directory server and a certificate server inside it. So it's all in one package 
	and which works as an active directory server for linux. It is same you are managing the password policies, you are 
	managing sudoers you are managing everthing centrally from one location which will be your IPA server.
	So it manages the identity of machines, Identity of services, identity of servers and manages the polices related 
	to your services and makes logs of accounting.
 
	So we can say it 
	1)IPA is servers and Domain controller for Linux
	2)create identity stores maeans it stores the idenntity of users
	3)centralized authentication
	4)domain control for kerberos and DNS services
	5)authentication policies
	6)NTP and Certificate Servers
 
	Componenets of IPA 
	1)Dogstag Certificate System
	2)389 Directory Server
	3)Kerberos KDC with LDAP BAckened
	4)Apache for Web BAsed Services
	5)ipa_kpassword
